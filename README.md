## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- Shorten any valid URL
- See a list of their shortened links, even after refreshing the browser
- Copy the shortened link to their clipboard in a single click
- Receive an error message when the `form` is submitted if:
  - The `input` field is empty

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Material UI](https://mui.com/) - For styles

### What I learned

This was a very fun challenge. It's the first landing page I've ever built with React JS.
I learned a lot working on this project:

- How to set overflow to hidden
- How to build on default styles available on MUI components & variants
- How to use the dev console to debug layout issues.
- How to not get lost reading stackoverflow commentsðŸ‘€ðŸ‘€ðŸ‘€

All in all, a really fun project.

I'm really proud of this code below. The component controls form submission & saves api response.
It helped me understand how to share data (state) among components without relying on the useContext hook

```react js
<div>
      <LinkForm
        onFormValueChange={handleFormValue}
        onSnackbarSuccess={handleSnackbarSuccess}
      />
      <LinkList responseList={responseList} />
</div>
```

### Continued development

My layout skills is improving, but we still need to stretch it more.
I'd also love to work more with APIs. I wanna use react query in my next project
